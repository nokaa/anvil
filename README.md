# Forge [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nokaa/forge.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nokaa/forge)
Forge is my experiment with text editors. I wanted to see what makes a text editor a text editor.

At this time, Forge is shaping up to be a basic Vi clone. It currently has a very basic command mode and an insert mode.
We are able to display file contents in a user interface, and we also have a basic prompt which shows the filename.

Currently, we are unable to actually modify the file. We can modify the contents of the ui, but we are unable to
write these changes to file at this time.
