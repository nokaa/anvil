# Forge

Forge is an experimental text editor that borrows ideas from Vim and Emacs.

Forge intends to be as fast as possible while staying as small as possible.
It should be easy to read through the source and directly modify Forge.

Forge aims to have a plugin model that uses rpc. This allows plugins to
be written in any language and be arbitrarily complex.
