# Forge

Forge is an experimental text editor that borrows ideas from Vim and Emacs.

Forge intends to be as fast as possible while staying as small as possible.
It should be easy to read through the source and directly modify Forge.

Forge aims to have a plugin system as powerful as Emacs'. This should make
almost anything possible. Forge also aims to have a better plugin language
than VimLang.

Forge plans to have a dank-ass UI based on the good old TTY, but with some
[special sauce](https://github.com/withoutboats/notty) thrown in to make it even danker.
